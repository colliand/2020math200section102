This is a course in **Multivariable Calculus**. 

## Calculus in one versus many variables

### Calculus on $\mathbb{R}$

#### functions from  $\mathbb{R} \longmapsto  \mathbb{R}$


Let $$f: \mathbb{R} \longmapsto \mathbb{R} $$ be a function that maps the real line to the real line. This function's domain and range have the same dimension.

 What does a function look like? Can we understand a function visually? The **graph of a function:**

 $$ x \longmapsto f(x) = y $$

| visualization of function | domain $ \longmapsto $ range |
| -------------- | -----------                             |
| graph          | $ f: x \longmapsto y = f(x) $           |

 Function arise in descriptions of natural phenomena. Functions describe nature. We care about functions. What are your favorite functional relationships in nature? Can you find a functional relationship discussed in the news over the past week?
