This is a course in **Multivariable Calculus**. 

## Calculus in one versus many variables

### Calculus on $\mathbb{R}$

#### Functions from  $\mathbb{R} \longmapsto  \mathbb{R}$


Let $f: \mathbb{R} \longmapsto \mathbb{R}$ be a function that maps the real line to the real line. This function's domain and range have the same dimension.

 What does a function look like? Can we understand a function visually? The **graph of a function**

 $$ x \longmapsto f(x) = y $$

is the locus of points $\{ (x,f(x)) \in {\mathbb{R}^2}: x \in \mathbb{R} \}$. (This implicitly assumes that the domain of $f$ is the entire real line $\mathbb{R}$.) 
 Function arise in descriptions of natural phenomena. Functions describe nature. We care about functions. What are your favorite functional relationships in nature? Can you find a functional relationship discussed in the news over the past week?
